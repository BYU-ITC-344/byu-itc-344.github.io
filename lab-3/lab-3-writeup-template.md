## Written Answer
ABC Corporation is a medium-sized company that provides software development and IT consulting services. They have a main office and several remote offices across the country. The company's IT infrastructure includes a mix of physical and virtual servers, desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. They use a variety of software applications to support their business operations, such as email, customer relationship management, project management, and accounting.

ABC Corporation has experienced some data loss incidents in the past due to hardware failures, malware attacks, and human errors. These incidents have resulted in significant downtime and loss of revenue for the company. To prevent such incidents from happening again, the company decides to implement a backup solution that can ensure the availability and integrity of their critical data.

The company needs to ensure that backup data is protected from unauthorized access, theft, and corruption. They can use encryption, access controls, and auditing to secure backup data. They should also test the restore process to ensure that backup data is recoverable in case of a disaster.

To determine the requirements for the backup solution, ABC Corporation needs to answer the following questions:

1.	What data needs to be backed up?
2.	How often should backups be performed?
3.	How long should backups be retained?
4.	Where should backup data be stored?
5.	How should backup data be secured?
