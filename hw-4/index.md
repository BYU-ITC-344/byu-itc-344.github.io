# Homework 4 – Rolling Release OS & Enterprise Risk

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand **rolling release operating systems** and how they differ from fixed-release distributions.
* Analyze **patch cycles, stability tradeoffs, and enterprise risk** in adopting rolling release OS models.
* Connect rolling release patching models to **distributed computing and continuous deployment environments**.
* Develop a **risk-focused paper** that evaluates operational security concerns.


## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will research **rolling release operating systems** (e.g., Arch Linux, Manjaro, openSUSE Tumbleweed) and evaluate their **benefits and risks in enterprise environments**. While rolling releases offer the advantage of up-to-date software, they can introduce instability, untested patches, and security risks compared to long-term support (LTS) models like Debian or Ubuntu LTS.

You will also consider how rolling release models intersect with **distributed and virtualized enterprise environments**, where stability, uptime, and predictability are critical.

Your final deliverable will be a **short research paper** (1–2 pages, double-spaced, \~500–750 words) describing security risks, architectural tradeoffs, and best practices for organizations evaluating rolling release distributions.

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Research Rolling Release OS Models

Investigate the characteristics of rolling release distributions:

1. **Update Model**

   * Continuous updates instead of periodic releases.
   * Security and feature patches delivered in near real-time.

1. **Advantages**

   * Always up-to-date software.
   * Faster access to security fixes (when patches are stable).
   * Attractive for developers and cutting-edge environments.

1. **Disadvantages / Risks**

   * Instability due to untested or poorly integrated patches.
   * Breakage in dependencies or mission-critical applications.
   * Lack of formal vendor support (in many cases).


### Step 2: Security & Enterprise Risk Analysis

Identify the **security implications** of adopting a rolling release OS in enterprise:

* **Operational Risk** – frequent updates can cause downtime or service disruption.
* **Patch Risk** – patches may fix vulnerabilities quickly, but may also introduce regressions.
* **Compliance Risk** – many enterprises require certified or LTS-supported systems.
* **Training/User Risk** – constant changes can increase the learning curve for staff.

Tie this into enterprise environments:

* In **distributed computing clusters**, a bad patch could break thousands of nodes.
* In **virtualized environments**, rolling releases may complicate snapshot/versioning strategies.
* In **DevOps/CI-CD**, rolling releases align with continuous deployment but require stricter testing pipelines.


### Step 3: Mitigation & Best Practices

Propose strategies for safely using rolling release OS in enterprise contexts:

* **Testing/QA environments** – test patches before deploying to production.
* **Snapshotting & Rollback** – use VM snapshots or Btrfs/ZFS rollbacks before major upgrades.
* **Hybrid Deployment** – use rolling releases in dev/test environments, but stable LTS in production.
* **Automation** – enforce automated patch management and monitoring tools.
* **Monitoring & Logging** – detect instability or failed upgrades quickly.

## Deliverables

Your research paper should:

* Be **1–2 pages**, double-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 pt
* Include an **introduction**, **body**, and **conclusion**.
* Use **proper grammar, spelling, and citations** if you reference external sources.
* Clearly address:

  1. **What rolling release OS distributions are and how they function.**
  2. **What risks they introduce in enterprise environments.**
  3. **What mitigation or best practices can help manage those risks.**
