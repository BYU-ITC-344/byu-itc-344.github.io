title: Final Project
---

The final project is worth **250 points total** (25% of your grade). It is designed to evaluate your ability to work as part of a team, apply concepts learned in class, and tackle a challenging operating-systems-related problem.

**Breakdown of points:**

- Ungraded: Team Formation
- 100 Points: A Working Project
- 100 Points: Documentation
- 40 Points: Final Presentation
- 10 Points: Peer Evaluation

## Team Formation

You will form teams of **3 or 4 students**. For the *Team Formation* assignment (not graded), you must report who is on your team. If you do not have a team, notify us and you will be assigned to an instructor-assembled team.

- Only **one team member** needs to submit the working project and documentation.
- The **presentation** will be graded by the professor.
- **Peer evaluations** must be submitted by each student individually.
## Project Components

### Documentation (100 Points)

Your documentation should tell the story of your project. It must include:

* The steps you took to complete your project
* Design decisions and justifications
* Problems or errors you encountered and how you resolved them
* Setup and usage instructions
* External tools/resources you used (with proper references)

If someone else read your documentation, they should be able to **recreate your project**.

### A Working Project (100 Points)

By the end, your project should be **functional and demonstrable**. It should serve a real purpose, align with your design goals, and show meaningful effort from the team.

### Final Presentation (40 Points)

During the last week of class, your team will present your project. This presentation should include:

* The problem or purpose of your project
* An overview of your design and decisions
* A live or recorded demonstration of your project deliverables

### Peer Evaluation (10 Points)

At the conclusion of your project, each student must evaluate their teammatesâ€™ contributions. The composite score (from self and team feedback) will determine your grade for this section.

## Project Options

Choose **one** of the following projects (or propose your own). These are intentionally challenging. You will likely need to research online, experiment with existing tools, and problem-solve creatively. While you may seek advice from experts, **all work must be completed by your team**.

### Suggested Projects

#### Create Your Own Linux Distro

Use [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) or a similar resource to create a custom Linux distribution.

- Define a **specific use case** (e.g., lightweight IoT device, forensic analysis, penetration testing, educational distro).
- Justify your design decisions.
- Produce an ISO that others can install and test.

Taking an existing ISO will not be permitted. The operating system must be made from scratch.

#### Resource Monitoring Dashboard for Data Center Infrastructure

Build a web-based monitoring dashboard that includes:

- **Real-time data visualization** (CPU, RAM, disk, network, power, temperature)
- **Alerts for critical events**
- Data collected via SNMP, IPMI, DRAC/iDRAC, UPNP, or other protocols

#### Process Scheduling Simulator

Develop a simulator that models various process scheduling algorithms (Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, Shortest Job First, Multilevel Queue, etc.).

- Provide **visualizations** of scheduling behavior.
- Compare performance across different workloads.

#### Custom Shell or Command Interpreter

Write your own shell with features such as:

- Parsing and executing commands
- Pipelining and redirection
- Basic scripting support

#### OS Security Hardening Project

Choose a base Linux or BSD distribution and implement **system hardening** measures.

- Configure firewall, auditing, SELinux/AppArmor, intrusion detection, and logging etc.
- Provide a **hardening guide** and a before/after security comparison.

### Other Projects

If you would like to propose a different project, it must be approved by the professor. Your idea should:

- Be directly related to **operating systems**
- Be of similar **scope and difficulty** as the projects above
