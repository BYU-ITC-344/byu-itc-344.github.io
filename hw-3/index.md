# Homework 3 – Legacy Systems & OS Architecture

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand **OS architecture** concepts such as process scheduling, memory management, and user authentication.
* Identify **security risks** associated with legacy operating systems.
* Develop skills in **risk assessment and mitigation planning** for legacy systems.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will analyze the **Windows 7 operating system**, focusing on its architectural components and the security risks associated with running an unsupported OS. You will evaluate legacy security flaws and propose mitigation or migration strategies for organizations still dependent on Windows 7 systems.

Your final deliverable will be a **short paper** (1–2 pages, double-spaced, \~500–750 words) that addresses OS architectural weaknesses, associated risks, and recommendations.

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Research Windows 7 Architecture

Investigate the following aspects of Windows 7:

1. **Authentication & Directory Services**

   * Legacy authentication protocols (LM/NTLM) and their weaknesses.
   * How Active Directory in older versions can be exploited.
   * Risks from weak password hashing, lack of multi-factor authentication support.

1. Analyze the **potential impact** of leaving Windows 7 systems in production (data loss, ransomware, regulatory compliance).
1. Consider the **likelihood** of exploitation based on known vulnerabilities and attack trends.
1. Use a simple **risk matrix** or table to summarize your findings (optional but recommended).


### Step 2: Mitigation & Migration Strategy

Provide recommendations for reducing risk, including:

* **Patching / Upgrade:** Migrating to a supported OS (Windows 10/11, Linux alternatives).
* **Isolation:** Segregating legacy systems on isolated networks.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** Enhancing visibility to detect malicious activity.
* **Compensating Controls:** Using firewalls, endpoint protection, and restricted access while migration occurs.

## Deliverables

Your paper should:

* Be **1–2 pages**, double-spaced.
* Include an **introduction**, **body**, and **conclusion**.
* Use **proper grammar, spelling, and citations** if you reference external sources.
* Clearly explain:

  1. **OS architectural weaknesses** of Windows 7
  1. **Security risks** posed by continued use
  1. **Mitigation and migration strategies**

| **Category** | **Excellent (Full Points)**  | **Proficient (Partial Points)** | **Needs Improvement (Minimal/No Points)**  | **Points** |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Legacy OS Risk Assessment**    | Provides a **thorough and accurate analysis** of Windows 7 OS architecture. Clearly explains weaknesses in **authentication, directory services, memory management, and process scheduling.** Demonstrates deep understanding of how these flaws translate into security risks.          | Covers some architectural weaknesses but analysis may be **superficial or incomplete.** Misses one or more key areas (e.g., authentication risks or AD flaws). Demonstrates a general but limited understanding of risks. | Fails to identify key weaknesses, provides **inaccurate or vague descriptions,** or omits analysis entirely.                             | 40         |
| **Risk Mitigation Strategy**     | Provides **comprehensive recommendations** including migration paths, compensating controls, monitoring, and isolation. Connects strategies directly to identified weaknesses and risks. Demonstrates critical thinking about **realistic implementation** in an organizational context. | Provides some recommendations, but they may be **generic, disconnected from risks, or missing detail.** Limited explanation of how strategies reduce risk.                                                                | Recommendations are **unclear, missing, or impractical.** No clear connection between risks and mitigation.                              | 30         |
| **Use of Risk Assessment Tools** | Effectively uses a **risk matrix or structured framework** (likelihood × impact) to summarize vulnerabilities and risks. Provides clear justification for scoring/placement.                                                                                                             | Attempts a risk matrix or structured tool, but presentation may be **incomplete, unclear, or poorly justified.**                                                                                                          | No attempt at a matrix or structured risk evaluation. Risks are described without analysis.                                              | 10         |
| **Clarity & Writing Quality**    | Paper is **well-organized, polished, and professional.** Free of grammar/spelling errors. Ideas flow logically with strong **intro, body, and conclusion.** Length requirement met (1–2 pages, \~500–750 words).                                                                         | Paper is **underdeveloped or somewhat disorganized.** Contains minor grammar/spelling issues. Some sections unclear or repetitive. May slightly miss length requirement.                                                  | Paper is **poorly written, hard to follow, or significantly off-length.** Contains frequent grammar/spelling errors. No clear structure. | 10         |
| **Use of Sources & Evidence**    | Integrates **credible sources** (academic, industry, or official Microsoft/US-CERT documentation) to support claims. Uses proper **citations** where appropriate.                                                                                                                        | Uses limited sources or relies on **uncited general knowledge.** Citations may be incomplete or inconsistent.                                                                                                             | Provides **no supporting evidence.** No citations used for external material.                                                            | 10         |
