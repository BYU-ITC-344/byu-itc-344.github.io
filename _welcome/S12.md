* Midterm Exam, Question 14 was flawed. While you can install Proxmox as a type-2 hypervisor it's difficult and Proxmox is not intended to be used that way. Accordingly, I changed the scoring to give you points regardless of your answer on that question. About a third of you got a boost on your exam score.
* Lab 4, Password Recovery due next Wednesday
* Final Project
    * Those who provided your team membership have that recorded in LearningSuite. Those who asked to be assigned to a team have email asking you to confirm that the assignments I have made are acceptable. Please confirm by email.
    * **New task:** by next Monday submit your final project subject. Only one member of your team needs to submit.
