* Lab 5 is Underway: Malware Detection and Removal.
* No pop quiz today.
* If your project involves process scheduling simulation - pay attention on Wednesday.
* We may reduce next week's Storage Devices lectures to a single session. That would free up a lecture. Send me ideas of what you would like to learn about!
