* Homework 2 is due Monday.
    * There are correct answers for some questions that the autograder doesn't necessarily catch. If you get a question wrong and you think you're right, you probably are. Please check with a TA.
* Lab 1 is due on Wednesday.
* Lab 2 kickoff is also on Wednesday.
* Lecture is in CTB 365 today (obviously). It will be in CTB 350 on Wednesday. After that we will survey you for your room preference.
