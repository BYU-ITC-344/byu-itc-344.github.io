* Homework 2 is underway, due Monday.
    * There are correct answers for some questions that the autograder doesn't necessarily catch. If you get a question wrong and you think you're right, please check with a TA.
* Keep working on Lab 1! The week will pass surprisingly quickly.
* Lecture is in CTB 250 today (obviously). It will be in CTB 365 on Monday.
