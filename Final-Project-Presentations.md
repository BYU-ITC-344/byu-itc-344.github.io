title: Final Project Presentations
---

Final project presentations will be in the last two classes of the semester. Both days we will use the whole class period plus the lab period with a 10 minute break between the two. Your presentation and documentation combined serve as evidence of a working project. 

You have 10 minutes to present with two minutes between presentations to switch between groups. In order to give enough time for every group, we will cut you off at the 10 minute mark. If you want to take questions (which we recommend), you should plan to present for seven or eight minutes and take questions for the balance of your time.

## Suggested Outline

Here is a rough outline to start from. You do not need to follow this outline but you should strive to cover major topics here and your presentation should have a clear organization.

* Introduction
    * Team Members
    * Project Subject
    * Planning considerations
* Project
    * What you did
    * Challenges, and how you overcame them
* Demo or Screenshots
    * A live demo is best but, if that's not possible or would take too much time, then use screenshots or other means to show what you built.
* Conclusion
    * Value of the project
    * Things you learned
    * Things you would do differently
