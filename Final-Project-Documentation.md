title: Final Project Documentation
---

Your final project documentation is due on the last day of class (before reading day and final exams). Your documentation should provide sufficient information that someone could use the product or repeat the experiment. It should also report on your process for creating the project similar to what you offer in the live presentation. Your presentation and documentation combined serve as evidence of a working project.

## Creation and Submission

**Submit your documentation to LearningSuite in PDF format.** Use whatever tool you want to produce the documentation so long as it can produce a **PDF** (MS Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, MarkDown, Overleaf/LaTeX, etc.).

## Examples

* Documentation for a Linux Distro would have information about how to install and use the distro. It would describe what is different between this and other distros. The creation part would describe how you decided which features to include and sources of information.
* Documentation for a Kubernetes Cluster would describe your cluster, what it accomplishes, and what tests you performed on its functions. The creation part would describe your planning process and sources of information.
* Documentation for a resource monitoring dashboard would describe what the dashboard shows and how to interpret the data. The creation portion would describe what tools you chose, why, and sources of information.

## Suggested Outline

Here is a rough outline to start from. Due to the variety of subjects, you should use your judgment and adapt this to present your project in a way that effectively communicates its subject, goals, process, and results.

* Identification
    * Team number
    * Team name (if applicable)
    * Team members
    * Project name or type
* Introduction
    * What the project does
    * Benefits of the project
* Documentation
    * Summary of what the project does
    * Appropriate screenshots and/or illustrations
    * How to use the project (if relevant)
    * What can be learned from the project
* Creation
    * Goals of the project
    * Your process of creation
    * Challenges, and how you overcame them
    * Sources of information, tools, code, etc.
* Conclusion
    * Value of the project
    * Things you learned
    * Things you would do differently

## Academic Integrity

Writing should be original unless clearly quoted. Source materials should be cited. Do not have AI generate your content.

## Length and Format

We have no page count, word count, font size, or margin guidelines. Please make the document long enough to cover the subject but not so long that it gets boring or repetitive. Use fonts, margins, headings and such that make the document appealing and easy to read. Be sure to cite references to any external materials that you used including websites, instructions, and so forth. Use any citation format that works for you.

## Grading Rubric

100 Points Possible

|&nbsp;|Excellent|Good|Needs Improvement|Not Performing|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Documentation**<br/>20 points|Project is described such that the reader could use a product or understand what an experiment means.|Project is described clearly but a reader would have difficulty replicating what was done based on the information given.|The purpose of the project, how it works, and how it might be used is unclear.|Project information is disorganized and hard to understand.|
|**Creation**<br/>20 points|Goals of the project are clear. There is a description of the steps the team followed. Challenges and obstacles are described along with their solutions.|Describes the purpose of the project but some steps in the development process are missing.|The narrative of the development process is unordered and hard to understand.|It is hard to tell how the team went about the work; word salad.|
|**Depth of Coverage**<br/>10 points|Thorough and insightful coverage of the topic; demonstrates deep understanding.|Good coverage of the topic; demonstrates solid understanding.|Basic coverage of the topic; demonstrates some understanding.|Superficial coverage of the topic; demonstrates limited understanding.|
|**Organization**<br/>20 points|There is a clear and consistent organizational structure to the document (specific introduction and conclusion, sequenced material within the body, and transitions). The organization is skillful and makes for a cohesive presentation.|There is a clear and consistent organizational structure to the presentation.|There is some organizational structure but it isn't consistently followed.|Poorly organized; lacks clear structure.|
|**Materials**<br/>20 points|Uses appropriate and relevant supporting material such as illustrations, tables, statistics, analogies, and/or quotations.

|**Relevance and Accuracy**<br/>10 points|Highly relevant and accurate information; uses credible sources effectively. There is a clear and compelling central message.|Relevant and accurate information; sources are mostly credible; message is clear.|Mostly relevant and accurate information; some credible sources used.
